    "One common explanation for the Lakers's underperformance is that as a result of the injuries plaguing the team, the Lakers were unable to reach their full potential. Lebron himself has been quoted as saying, \"The reason we were not very good together is we weren’t on the damn floor together.\" In the quote, \"we\" refers to 3 players in particular: LeBron James, Anthony Davis, and Russell Westbrook. We will examine the relative performance of the lakers with and without key combinations of players to determine if certain player absences had a significant effect on the team's performance.\n",

    "Doing so yields a winrate of about 38.5%. For our statistical model, we model the Lakers' season with a binomial distribution. You can read more about the binomial distribution here: http://www.stat.yale.edu/Courses/1997-98/101/binom.htm. As it applies here, we assume the Lakers' have a certain probability for winning each game, and the result of each game is independent from the result of all others. We take that probability to be the 38.5% we calculated, so we assume that team's performance (probability of victory for each game) is determined purely from the individual contribution of Davis and LeBron. Our question then is, what is the probability that the 50% win rate acheived when LeBron and Davis were playing together simply happend by chance? Or is it that the combination of the two players created a synergy that led to the strong performance?\n",

    "We should consider whether a binomial distribution is really appropriate to model the team's games. We can definitely treat each game as a bernoulii trial, with outcomes win and not win for the lakers. Each game is, in theory, not influeced by previous games, so we can treat the outcome of each game as independent events. Indeed, the idea of the \"hot hand,\" where a string a successes implies a greater chance of future success is a fallacy when considering independent trials. However, some have argued that effect can exist in practice, as the psychological effects of the results of prior games/events can influence future performance. In other words, the events aren't truly independent. Whether the \"hot hand\" exists empiracally is still up for debate. However, here, we will assume that the outcomes of games are truly independent, allowing us to apply the binomial distribution.\n",
