# LakersAnalysis

### Possible Things to Look at 

* This season, injuries plagued the Lakers. Their top three players (Russell Westbrook, LeBron James, Anthony Davis) seldom played together at the same time, because James and Davis got injured throughout the season. We could have one graph looking at game wins when Davis is injured vs when Davis plays, or when all three are on court vs. when one of them is out due to injury.
* Lakers were known to have great defense in 2020 (I think there are stats illustrating that, i.e. # of points given up to the opposing team throughout the season). This season Lakers defense is ass.
* Major trades/signings made since the winning 2020 season, these are just my opinions of the major moves - if we can find dataset on trades on how much each contract is worth, we could do some cool stuff with the Lakers are allocating their money / whether they're getting bang for their buck 
  * Signed Avery Bradley 10/18/2021
  * Traded Marc Gasol to Memphis Grizzlies 9/10/2021
  * Signed Rajon Rondo 8/31/2021
  * Resigned Talen Horton-Tucker 8/6/2021
  * Traded Montrezl Harrell, Kyle Kuzma, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope to the Washington Wizards to get Russell Westbrook 	8/6/2021
  * Signed Carmelo Anthony 8/6/2021
  * Signed Dwight Howard	8/6/2021
* Russell Westbrook has been blamed for a lot of losses - we can look at his individual performance this season vs. past seasons where he played for other teams
